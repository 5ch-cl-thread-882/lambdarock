<h1>Culture</h1>

<b>This is a sketch with some ideas, feel free to disagree and suggest
other ways to do things.</b>

<p>Human history is a known reference point and I'll use it heavily in
my description, and in particular western/european history.
Contraband is a game of schemes, backstabbing, smuggling,
war-mongering and secret operations.. but it's also a game with two
mighty countries with a common border.  The two countries have no
direct parallells in european history, but can clearly be identified
with two eras and their respective cultures.  The experiment is seeing how these
two eras more than thousand years apart would act if placed next to
each other. </p>

<h3>Empire of Copia</h3>

<img src="photo_tacitus.jpg" align=left>
<p>The first successful civilisation in Europe can be said to start
with the greeks and continue with the romans.  This is also a
well-documented era of wars, cultures, technical advances and amazing
development of organisational ideas and structures.  Contraband is not
a game about why Rome or Athens came to be or how they fell.. and it
is not about making a carbon copy of these cultures.  However, the
Empire of Copia will steal several parts from the era:</p>
<br clear=all>

<ul>
  <li> Efficient bureaucracy that can do amazing logistics, but in
  general have no ethics about the results of their actions.
  Bureaucrats are in general aiming to secure or advance their own
  position in the bureaucracy or in the outside world.  They can give
  interesting jobs but might not make sense ethically, but is loyalty
  and "honour" stronger than individual ethics?  Players must at some
  stage make a choice of whether this is a system they want to work
  within.  When making quests/jobs/tasks feel free to make them
  bureaucratic, technically and legally correct, and sometimes make
  the player take tough moral decisions.  Tempting players with
  corruption when the alternative to saying 'yes' is hard might also
  be an idea. </li>
  
  <li> Several strong factions in the empire have control or influence
  of various parts of the bureaucracy, and these factions may come in
  conflict with each other, requiring their bueraucrats to do actions
  that may not be in the empire's best interest and may damage others.
  If the player has decided to stick with the empire, he or she must
  make choices on who in the empire he supports and it should have
  consequences.  Will a player inform higher-up commanders when their
  closest commander is obviously not acting in the best interest of
  the empire?</li>
  

  <li> Strong military tradition that at times cross over with the
  bureaucracy.  The copian armies are mainly infantry, but very strong
  infantry with body shields and long pikes.  It's an honour to be in
  the mighty copian armies, and they do wonderful parades.  But beyond
  the romantic picture is a wretched life revealing abuse, extortion,
  plunder, rape and cruelty to soldiers, citizens and those
  unfortunate to come in the soldiers' way.  Tempting the player in
  with the romantic ideal, and gradually let him or her see the rotten
  side of it might work.  This might be done by letting the player be
  recruited for missions and seeing things first hand, or let a
  bureaucratic player become investigator of alleged crimes. </li>

  <li> Several roman/greek stereotypical characters to mix the
  impression of the above bureaucracy and the military.  Examples are
  the legendary commander, the rich but cynical commander, the
  scheming "senator", the people's senator, arrogant priest, runaway
  slave (maybe not mention slavery early on, but reveal it gradually
  as matter-of-fact), the hopeless poet, the cruel drill sergeant, the
  cynical field sergeant, the local commander with dark secret, etc.
  Watching Ben Hur, Spartacus, Gladiator, etc typically reveal these
  people.  Feel free to beef up the characters with odd traits, but
  basically (and in roman theatre tradition) the characters are just
  roles (with a twist).  They will typically not be clear-cut good or evil, but will
  have good sides and evil sides.. e.g the people's senator might be
  cruel to slaves or the ruthless commander might be a sponsor of
  grand plays.  These can be personalities that might or might not control
  factions, characters the player can trust, come to hate, etc.  
  Let their traits be human and something that one can identify with,
  they are not timeless elves or born-to-be-evil orcs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kingdom of Atrocitas</h3>

<p>If the copians are greeko-roman, the atrocitans are western
europeans in the early rennaissance.  The united kingdom of Atrocitas
consist of several small warlike kingdoms, duchies and city-states
that has been forced into being one country.  Although this has been
the situation for more than a century and the king wields strong power
the country is still more or less ruled by nobles.  The atrocitan
forces are paid for by nobles, and although the king is the commander
of all the forces, the nobles still have considerable influence.</p>

<img src="crusknight2.gif" align=right>
<p>Atrocitans know wars and they know the cruelty of war, and their
Deus Atrox is a classic warrior god complete with eternal life for
those who fall in combat, chivalry and honourable death.  Deus Atrox
is also seen as the god responsible for the atrocitan kingdom and how
it is run.  Though,
things are changing in the kingdom, and a church dedicated to healing,
medicine and science is growing strong.  Although the Deus Salveus
priests have not claimed absolute pasifism, they're often opposed to
war and the destruction it leads to.  The Deus Salveus priests seem
focused on the serfs' and farmers' problems, and often oppose tyranny
and oppression from local dukes and lords.. but the church has not
as a whole asked for a revolution.  Yet the two churches are obviously
in conflict, and wage a war for the soul of the atrocitan citizen.</p>

<ul>
  <li> The kingdom is in a difficult position with a dead king and the
  country needs to find a way forward.  The Copian Empire is hungry
  for more land and if Atrocitas seems weaker the copians will
  attack mercilessly.  Though, a united and aggressive Atrocitas will
  threaten Copia, but Atrocitas is seldom united.  This might be a
  possible way for a player to go.
  
  <li> The many dukes and factions in the kingdom will scheme against
  copians, other atrocitan dukes and other atrocitan factions.  The
  worst result is a civil war, and it is a realistic outcome because
  many dukes want more power and want to back their prince for the
  throne.  The oldest son favours Deus Salveus which is by Deus Atrox
  followers seen as a weak pasifist god which could not handle
  aggressive copian forces.  And they're probably right.  Several
  quests and plots can be created here, either to further faction
  interests, work for a civil war and against a civil war.  The Prince
  Vehemen, which is the foremost knight of the kingdom, should be a
  wildcard for a long time.. nobody knows what he is up to.  However,
  both the Deus Salveus and Deus Atrox priests and followers are all
  aggressive (in their own way), and if they join forces this will be
  dangerous for the copian forces.</li>

  <li> The player will start working as a spy for the Foreign Office
  and indirectly Prince Callidus, but should be able to join up with
  other factions.  While Prince Callidus may be described for the
  player by his opponents as an evil
  spider scheming for his own power, he is the only one of the princes
  who knows how to rule the kingdom.  He can work the bureaucracy, he
  knows foreign and interior diplomacy and he controls the
  intelligence service.  He is a key to avoiding civil war and to
  uniting the kingdom if it can serve his interests.  Several of the
  quests for Callidus should also indirectly benefit his
  business-empire, typically by making life hard for copian merchants
  and copian agents.</li>
