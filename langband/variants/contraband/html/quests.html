<h1>Faction: Atrocitas Foreign Office</h1>

<b>Deliver Letter to Tepesco:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li> Who: [foreign office]
  <li> When: At start for atrocitan player
  <li> Job: Deliver sealed letter to Consul Tepesco.  Move from bottom
  right corner to upper left corner in Bartertown where the consulate
  lies. 
</ul>

<b>Fix paperwork for a caravan:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li> Who: Consul Tepesco
  <li> When: delivered letter (MTF)
  <li> Job: A caravan will be coming to Bartertown from Atrocitas, but
  needs paperwork done at the southern bridge to let it pass.  The
  officers at the souther bridge are mostly interested in bribes.  One
  can do things by the book and be lucky, but the chance is better if
  you do the paperwork and bribe the officers with booze.  [The player
  will learn how things work around here quickly]  Return to consul
  for an update. 
</ul>

<b>Help arrested traders:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li> Who: Consul Tepesco
  <li> When: paperwork mission done (MTF)
  <li> Job: Some traders have been arrested for smuggling and are
  locked up in Mont Renuo.  Investigate what happened, and if they're
  innocent do what is possible to get them released, possibly with
  their goods and caravan.  The men were trying to bring leather
  armours across the southern bridge.. and the Mereo wanted to stop
  trading of armour.  This can be solved in two manners.. go by the
  book and find the trade deal which allows sale of leather products
  and then piss off captain perpetro.. or it can be solved by bribing
  the prison guards into releasing them because they have starving
  family at home.
</ul>

<b>Meet traders' guild:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li> Who: Consul Tepesco
  <li> When: paperwork mission done (MTF)
  <li> Job: Get list of incoming and outgoing caravans for the next
  week from the leader of the traders' guild, Antonio, and ask where they need help.
  Basically meet Antonio and get info from him which
  should be returned to Tepesco.  Opens up Antonio for further
  missions and assignments.
</ul>

<h1>Faction: Imperial Agency</h1>

<b>Deliver letter to Ulydes:</b><br>

<ul>
  <li> Who: [agency]
  <li> When: At start for copian player
  <li> Deliver sealed letter to Mereo Ulydes in Bartertown.  Copia
  player starts in upper left part of town so this will be
  quick. Guard at house that may be easily persuaded. 
</ul>

<b>Deliver letter to Junifer:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li> Who: [agency]
  <li> When: At start for copian player
  <li> Deliver sealed letter to Mereo Junifer in Mont Renuo.  Copia
  player starts in upper left part of town so this might not happen
  right away. 
</ul>

<b>Get silk dress for Captain Perpetro:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li> Who: Captain Perpetro
  <li> When: delivered letter to junifer
  <li> Wants player to get hold of a green silk dress made by the
  elves.  this dress is for Mereo Junifer.  This is misuse of a good
  agent, but the legions don't care much about agents. 
</ul>

<h3> Ride shotgun on caravan (ATRO)</h3>

<p>Player gets mission from Consul Tepesco, and it is a bad mission
because the player is there as clerk not as guard.  Can't argue.. gets
opportunity (and 30 florentins) to buy equipment and when reporting
back there is a caravan that needs to get safely to the border to
Atrocitas.  Before the bridge some thieves will attack from the
forest.  Guards should be able to kill them, but help from player is
good.  On bridge there is a customs check.. player can talk the
caravan through, otherwise it must pay 200 florentins.  If the player
talks it through he gets 50 florentins from the caravan owner.  Then
near the border some Salveus priests will attack the caravan which is
filled with Imperial Wine.. they will use fire-arrows and the caravan
will blow up.  Three ways to do this.. talk to the priests and convince
them not to do it (hard, bribing does not help), or convince the
caravan owner to go back and use another border crossing, or if you
support the priests, help to blow up the caravan.  Afterwards
player must go back to the consul, where reward is given depending on
outcome. </p>
