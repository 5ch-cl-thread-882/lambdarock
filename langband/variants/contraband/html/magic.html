<h1>Magic in Contraband</h1>

<p>The World of Contraband, Daear, is rich in myths and legends of mighty
sorcerors, dragons and of gods walking the earth.  Almost everybody believes
in magic and dragons, and of gods playing an active part in both
big and small events.  The world is no longer like the myths...</p>

<b>The end of magic</b>
<p>In the Age of Wars the magicians of old more or
less disappeared in wars, magical duels, killed by magical beasts and
sometimes even destroyed by the magic forces.  In their place lesser
"wizards" came, that were mere dabblers that could do some illusion
tricks to impress commoners, mix potions and tell people's fortune
from tea leaves.  The magicians of old that tapped nature itself for
magical power became history.  Commoners believe the magicians of old
are still out there in the dark, and brave adventurers seek out ruins
of old to find the secrets of old magic, but few of them come back,
and those who do come back are often insane.</p>

<b>The end of the magical beasts</b>
<p>During the Age of Wars there were dragons, unicorns and faeries in
the land.  Some of them were drawn into the wars and killed, others
were killed by the magicians for use in magical rituals and some of
them died of plague.  They haven't been seen for centuries, though
legends are hard to kill.  However, every village has a recent tale of a
werewolf howling at the moon, walking dead near graveyards or "the
little ones" stealing children in the night.</p>

<b>The disappearance of the gods</b>
<p>Before the Age of Wars the gods did take an active part in human
lives according to all tales.  They also built churches that did
miracles according to their gods' wishes.  The last tales of active
gods were in the Age of Wars, but since then it has been fairly quiet
and the churches' miracles are more mundane.  The churches claim that
their job is not to do miracles, but to teach of the gods and worship
of a god should come from a belief in the teaching not a belief in
miracles.  It is however widely believed that the organised churches
and even some cults still get magical powers from their gods and that
the big churches have records of old on how to tap into the power of
gods.  But the churches seem to be content with teaching.</p>


<b>The rise of the army</b>
<p>The Empire of Copia was the first country that formalised a big
bureaucracy to run things, and even the churches' role was
formalised.  There was no room in a well-ordered bureaucracy for the
eccentricities of magicians or wizards, and even before the Age of
Wars they had no visible place in the Copian hierarchy.  The churches'
miracles also failed to be "organised" in the Age of Wars as the
battle-priests were killed faster than new ones could be trained.  The
Copian commanders got used to novice priests whose role was to boost
morale rather than serve as juggernaughts in battles.  Gradually magic
lost it's place in the Empire, simply because the bureaucracy was so
efficient and predictable.  It is believed that magic is largely lost
to all aspects of Copian life.</p>

<b>The rise of science</b>
<p>The Kingdom of Atrocitas has always appreciated individual talent
and the skill of small groups more than their Copian neighbours.  As
such there was always a place for magicians that proved useful, and in
the Age of Wars the magicians often fought with the atrocitans against
foreign enemies and even against other atrocitan factions.  Their
success took it's toll on the magicians.  Known sources of magical
power were depleted, magicians were killed, secrets lost and desperate
for more power the magicians ventured into beastly lairs to kill
beasts for their eyes, horns, claws and hearts.  Few magicians
survived these conditions and those who did realised that their
future survival depended on peace and quiet.  The armoured knights
also become such a fearsome force on the battlefield that the
magicians could safely withdraw to hidden towers.</p>

<p>After the many wars the magicians weren't missed, and intelligent
men turned to study the mundane world instead of the magical arts.
Their research continued and through the big Academy in Atrobürg the
knowledge was spread.  Gradually the researchers found new ways to
describe nature and society that didn't depend on magic.  The rise of
the Church of Deus Salveus who also depended on mundane knowledge to
provide public health furthered this movement.  A few oddball
researchers are still doing research on old magic, but the trend at the Academy
is for meticulous study of nature.</p>
