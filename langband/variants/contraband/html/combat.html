<h1>Combat</h1>


<h3>Attack-strength</h3>

<p>Every combatant has a combat-strength with a given weapon.  This
combat-strength is an integer from 1 and up.  Values above 200
unlikely.  To calculate combat-strength this is the formula:</p>
<pre>
2 * ((weapon-skill * 5) + (ability * 2) + (to-hit bonus * 5) + modifiers)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             25
</pre>

<p>The weapon-skill depends on which weapon is used, e.g a long sword
uses the <tt>long-blades</tt> skill.  The ability used depends on the weapon as
well, e.g for a short-sword it is <tt>agility</tt>.  To-hit bonuses
include craftsmanship bonuses on a weapon or magical enchantments or
even bonuses depending on target.  Some modifiers depending e.g on
spells might also be added. </p>

<b>Example:</b>
<p>As an example we have the agent Athos who has just started the
game and have chosen fairly combat-oriented skills.  He has the
following values:</b>
<pre>
strength: 20
agility: 15
long-blades: 25
evasion: 10
shield: 10
light-armour: 20
heavy-armour: 20
</pre>

<p>His attack-strength with a rapier (uses agility) is:</b>
<pre>
2 * ( (25*5) + (15*2) + 0 + 0) / 25 = 2*155/25 = 12
</pre>

<h3>Defense-strength</h3>

<p>In Contraband armours are very valuable, and metal armour and a
shield may very well protect you against most attacks.  For a stealthy
character wearing no armour might also be a useful solution, but for
real combat a metal armour will be better.  Body-armour may also soak
some of the damage from an attack.  The formula to calculate the
defense-strength is:</p>
<pre>
(defense-skill * armour-rating)  + (shield-skill * shield-armour-rating) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                25

   +       ((2 * evasion) + agility)
        ------------------------------
         6 + armour-bulk + shield-bulk
</pre>

<p>Evasive abilities are reduced by wearing bulky armour and using a
bulky/heavy shield.  Every armour and shield has an armour rating
indicating the defense-capabilities of it.  This is multiplied with
the skill to use the armour or the skill as seen above. </p>

<b>Example</b>
Athos wearing clothing (rating: 2, bulk: 0, skill: light-armour), no shield
<pre> (20*2 + 0)/25  + (10*2+15)/6 = 6</pre>

Athos wearing leather armour (rating: 10, bulk: 4, skill:
light-armour), leather+wood-shield (rating: 4, bulk: 4)
<pre> (20*10 + 10*4)/25  + (10*2+15)/14 = 11</pre>

Athos wearing chain armour (rating: 25, bulk: 15, skill:
heavy-armour), heavy wood-shield (rating: 10, bulk: 8)
<pre> (20*25 + 10*10)/25  + (10*2+15)/24 = 24 + 1 = 25</pre>

Athos wearing plate armour (rating: 35, bulk: 25, skill:
heavy-armour), heavy wood-shield (rating: 10, bulk: 8)
<pre> (20*35 + 10*10)/25  + (10*2+15)/34 = 32 + 1 = 33</pre>

<p>As we can see the defense-strength increases rapidly with metal armour
and a decent shield.  The bulk will also affect movement, other
agility rolls, fatigue and energy-use.</p>

<h3>To-hit</h3>

<p>To find out how much of a chance someone has to hit another you use
the attack-strength vs the defense-strength with the formula:</p>

<pre>
% Chance to hit = 50% + ( 3% * (attack-strength - defense-strength))
</pre>

<p>There is always a 5% chance minimum chance to hit and a 5% minimum
chance to miss.</p>

<b>Example:</b>

<p>We'll pit Athos against his twin-brother armed with the
armour-combinations above:</p>

<pre>
Unarmed:  50% + (3% * (12 -  6)) = 50% + 18% = 68%
Leather:  50% + (3% * (12 - 11)) = 50% +  3% = 53%
Chain:    50% + (3% * (12 - 25)) = 50% - 39% = 11%
Plate:    50% + (3% * (12 - 33)) = 50% - 63% =  5% (minimum)
</pre>

<p>A more skilled Athos would have a bigger chance against better
armour.</p> 

<h3>Doing damage</h3>

<p>Provided that it was a succesful hit, we need to figure out the
damage.  This is another area where protective armour will help, as
protective body-armour (not shields) might soak some of the damage.
Each weapon does some base-damage, e.g a long-sword will do
<tt>1d8</tt> damage to a humanoid.  Base damage is calculated as:</p>

<pre>
damage-roll * ((2 * weapon-skill) + strength) 
---------------------------------------------  + weapon-bonuses + modifiers
                3 * 25
</pre>

<p>Weapon-bonuses might be craftsmanship bonuses to damage or even
magical bonuses.  Any extra modifiers might be backstab-damage,
higher-ground, etc.</p>

<p>The soak of an armour is relatively easy, the armour rating
indicates the ability to soak damage as:</p>
<pre>% chance for damage soak = armour-rating / 100</pre>

<p>So a brand new chain-armour with 25 armour rating will soak roughly
25% of the damage.  However, any soak will damage the armour with the
same amount as was soaked, thereby reducing the armour rating of the
armour and possibly destroying the armour.</p>


<b>Example</b>

<p>Athos attacks with a long-sword (1d8) but has no extra bonuses.</p>
<pre>
max: (8*(2*25 + 20))/(3*25) = 560 / 75 = 7
min: (1*(2*25 + 20))/(3*25) =  70 / 75 = 0 -> 1 (1 is the minimum)
</pre>
