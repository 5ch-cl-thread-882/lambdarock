<h3>Starting letter</h3>

    To _ _ _ _ _,<br><br>

    <p> Congratulations on finishing your studies at the Royal Academy
    of Atrobürg, and your professors tell me you finished with honours.  As we agreed
    last february at your father's mansion, I will be your employer and
    mentor the next two years, training you in the arts of diplomacy,
    trade and politics.  After King Aequus' death last week, things
    are very hectic and I send you this letter because there is no
    time to meet in person.</p>

    <p> The Kingdom is overrun by agents from the Empire of Copia, doing their best to
    create chaos after the King's death.  We fear that the imperial
    agents are doing this to create enough uncertainty and create
    conflicts in the Kingdom, so they can launch another of their
    cowardly attacks on us.  We have already caught several of their
    agents, carrying large amounts of money, no doubt to bribe
    nobles.  We also fear that the corrupt merchant guild of Copia
    will use this opportunity to attack our trade routes and atrocitan
    merchants.</p>

    <p> When we last met, you insisted that you wanted an "important
    job" and to "prove yourself and your worthiness".  It seems that
    Fate was listening to our conversation.  The Kingdom, myself and
    our families need you to go to the two border towns Bartertown and
    Lambda Rock in the Empire of Copia.  In Bartertown you will join
    the Atrocitan Consul Tepesco as a clerk and trainee.  Consul
    Tepesco will undoubtedly give you assignments to secure our trade
    with Copia and secure the peace, and you should do this.</p>

    <p> However, your most important job will be to report to me what
    happens in the border towns Bartertown and Lambda Rock.  You must
    gather as much information as you can about the Copian Merchant
    Guild's operations.  We also want to know more about the Atrocitan
    merchants operating on the border and their allegiances and
    deals.  Information on any Copian force movements is also vital and
    don't hesitate to send us any other information you find
    appropriate for our situation.</p>


    <p> With enough correct information we can judge the situation better 
    and avoid living in fear.  Fear will lead to more uncertainty and uncertainty
    will only strengthen the war mongering hawks, and only peace will
    give our Kingdom prosperity. </p>

    
     <p> You have received a sealed letter, that you should deliver to
    Consul Tepesco in Bartertown.  You have also received what we
    in the Foreign Office refer to as a 'Facts Machine'.  It is small
    and easily tucked away and worth more than ten trained horses.
    The Facts Machine can be fed scrolls and papers and will magically
    transport them to the Foreign Office, and we can send papers to your
    Facts Machine.  It is a great invention done by the Royal Magician
    Quinus.  This Facts Machine will allow you to keep us informed.  Don't
    let anyone else know of this device, not even the Consul.</p>

    <p> Treat the council and people you meet with respect and
    humility, remember that to them you're just another lowly clerk doing
    the required two years of service for the Kingdom to pay for your
    studies.  The Kingdom will provide you with one hundred silver
    florentins, which is what the copians use as currency.  It is a very
    large amount for a clerk, but we suspect your job will require you to
    bribe others for information.</p>

    <p> As an atrocitan in the Empire of Copia you have no special privileges and any
    crimes you're caught for will be punished by Copians.  The Foreign
    Office of the Kingdom of Atrocitan will not interfere with the Copian
    authorities on criminal matters.  It is therefore of utmost
    importance that you are careful and maintain your secret
    identity.  The Kingdom however reserves the right to punish you
    and your family for crimes against the Kingdom's interests.</p>

    <p> Prince Callidus, who manages foreign affairs after his
    father's death,  wishes you all luck and hopes that you will
    uncover more of what the Empire of Copia is up to.  Information about
    what's happening in Bartertown and Lambda Rock is of great
    importance to us.</p>
