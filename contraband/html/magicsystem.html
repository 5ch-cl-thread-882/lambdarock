<h1>Magic System</h1>

<p>The magic system in Contraband follows three important design
principles.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Magic is exotic and rare, but can be powerful
  <li> Magic corrupts the magician
  <li> Magic follows an orderly system
</ul>

<p>Sources of magic are more common than most people realise, but the
knowledge of how to tap these sources is rare and many of those who've
uncovered the secrets of magic aren't telling and in some cases are
unable to tell anymore.  Magic comes primarily from eleven magic
domains:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Aeris</b> - the air, weather, gravity and the flying creatures.  The aerial
  domain is often ignored and missed by many, but a magician with
  power of Aeris can control the air, the weather and get aid from
  creatures of the air.  It is said that magicians in this domain can
  summon powers from the emptiness of the World of Nothing.  Some old
  tales tell of
  Aeris magicians that destroys all air in a person's lungs or defies
  gravity. Diagonal domain: Terra.</li>

  <li> <b>Aqua</b> - the water, liquids and creatures native to the sea.
  Water is deeply respected by people as most people can't swim and
  large sharks are known to maim and kill swimmers.  A magician
  mastering the Aqua domain can control water, reshape water, command
  fish and even summon powers from the deepness of the World of
  Ocean. Diagonal domain: Ignis.</li>

  <li> <b>Arbor</b> - the plants, trees, herbs and products made from these,
  including food.  It's well-known that some priests have unique
  talents for making plants grow and prosper, and elves have a unique
  talent for shaping wood.  While not an aggressive domain, it's a
  domain one could surely be loved by farmers for mastering. Diagonal
  Domain: Mortis. </li>

  <li> <b>Bestia</b> - the animals, beasts and monsters of the world.
  Tapping into the bestiary domain can be a blessing as it can give
  you a deep understanding of animals and animals will feel drawn to
  you, but it also represents the fury and sheer power of the beast
  within.  Tales of old told of Bestia magicians that ended up as wild
  beasts and never came back. Diagonal domain: Hominid.</li>

  <li> <b>Hominid</b> - mankind and other manlike creatures.  The world is
  currently a world of men, and several creatures share
  characteristics and tap powers from the same domain.  A very
  powerful domain for any magician, but requires strong willed
  magicians more than any other domain. Diagonal domain: Bestia. </li>

  <li> <b>Ignis</b> - fire, heat and destruction.  No other domain has such a
  destructive force on lives of men and beast, and none are feared
  more.  Magicians mastering this element will be feared, and when
  captured they will be killed quickly.  Diagonal domain: Water.</li>

  <li> <b>Imago</b> - senses, illusions and phantasms.  Some might claim that
  we are what we perceive, and masters of Imago will use this fully by
  enhancing senses and tricking others' senses.  Conjuring up images
  of dragons to scare enemies, or covering up traps or even making
  images of themselves that enemies can attack while standing in
  safety are just some of the tricks of these tricksters. Diagonal
  domain: Sol. </li>

  <li> <b>Luna</b> - moon, night and minds.  Priests worshipping Luna will
  excel during the night or when there's a full moon.  Luna herself
  will grant her followers powers over creatures of the night,
  shapechanging powers and ability to reflect attacks back on
  attackers.  Mysterious and sometimes mad, magicians tapping into the
  domain of Luna will be secretive and sometimes fear people. Diagonal
  domain: Sol. </li>

  <li> <b>Mortis</b> - death, aging and undead.  People all fear death itself,
  but some strange people have always found it fascinating.  People's
  fear of death only rivals the fear of flame, and magicians suspected
  of tapping into Mortis will be killed quickly.  Magicians mastering
  Mortis will wield death, command the dead but may protect him from
  death itself.  Diagonal domain: Arbor. </li>

  <li> <b>Sol</b> - the sun, daytime and magic.  Farmers love the sun, at
  least when he doesn't stay too long, and priests of Sol are welcome
  with farmers.  For people fighting the dead the power of Sol is very
  useful, and bringing light into dark caverns is always welcome.
  Like Sol's opposite Luna, those who tap for too long into Sol might
  become mad. Those who want a reliable source of magic often tap into
  the eternal source of Sol and as such those who crave magic itself
  often specialise in Sol magic.  The light of the sun will also dispel
  illusions.  Diagonal domain: Luna.</li>

  <li> <b>Terra</b> - the earth, the mundane and metals.  Farmers work the
  earth, miners work the rock and soldiers rely on swords.  Terra is
  the domain that most professions are somehow connected to.
  Magicians tapping into Terra will become excellent artists and learn
  the secrets of many objects.  Most of the magicians tapping into
  this domain will rarely bother with the needs of the mundane, but
  will usually use the domain to create magical weapons and other
  objects.  Diagonal domain: Aeris. 
</ul>


<p> To tap into the domains magicians need various techniques and
disciplines.  Some magicians find the techniques more interesting than
the domains themselves, preferring to use a certain technique on many
domains instead of using many techniques on one domain.</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Agnosco</b> - to learn and perceive.  Magicians mastering this
  technique knows how to understand and direct the streams of power
  from the domains themselves and get information from them.  This is
  a technique for the curious and few magicians can risk doing wild
  experiments without checking their domain carefully.</li>

  <li> <b>Amplio</b> - to improve and enlarge.  Magicians mastering this
  discipline are known for channeling the power of a domain to enhance
  exisiting abilities and atributes.  Amplio magicians sometimes
  favour improving their own abilities, others turn a burning
  torch into a big flaming inferno and some enhance their plain
  weapons into deadly magic weapons. </li>

  <li> <b>Arcesso</b> - to call and summon.  Magicians mastering this
  discipline are experts at finding friends, weapons and even terrains
  from other places and worlds, and will call them to where he is.
  This might backfire badly but usually a gifted Arcesso magician may
  get just what he needs when he needs it and not worry much. </li>

  <li> <b>Creo</b> - to create and construct.  Some magicians love to create
  new things, and it's hard for magaicians to do without this
  discipline.  Combining Creo and Ignis can let you create flaming
  arrows out of thin air, or for Creo Imago create the illusion you
  need.  A Creo magician creates something of lasting value but it
  might not be as powerful as what an Arcesso magician can conjure
  from somewhere else.</li>

  <li> <b>Deleo</b> - to destroy and damage.  Sometimes you need to destroy
  illusions, quelch fires and sometimes you need to destroy your
  enemies.  Very few magicians can avoid having some training in this
  discipline, but be wary of those who specialise in destruction.</li>

  <li> <b>Mutatio</b> - to move, control and change.  The world isn't always
  what you would like it to be, so why not learn how to change and
  control it.  An excellent discipline for artists of all kinds, but
  if you like big explosions this is a boring discipline.</li>

  <li> <b>Novo</b> - to restore and make whole.  Sometimes things are
  destroyed or severly damaged and need repair.  This discipline is
  excellent for all those who want to fix things around them,
  including curing illnesses and mend wounds. </li>

  <li> <b>Tutis</b> - to protect and shield.  Not everyone is friendly to you
  or your items and sometimes it might help to protect them from
  various creatures and domain effects.  A good magician might protect
  his items so he does not need Novo. </li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Casting a spell</h3>

<p>To show how spellcasting works it's probably best with an example.
Bonuses and calculations may change, but it should give a good idea on
how things work. </p>

<blockquote>
<p> Pugicio is becoming a pretty good magician, and have gotten decent
skills and found some spells in his travels:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Character Level: 12
  <li> Agnosco: 3, Amplio: 2, Creo: 5, Deleo: 3, Mutatio: 5, Novo: 2,
  Tutis: 2
  <li> Aqua: 2, Arbor: 6, Bestia: 2, Ignis: 1, Sol: 3, Terra: 5
  <li> "Heroes Feast" (creo arbor), "Sand of the desert" (creo terra)
  and "Dissolve wall" (mutatio terra)
  <li> Silver runes: Arbor, Ignis, Novo
  <li> Stone runes: Agnosco, Creo, Sol, Aqua
  <li> Wooden runes: Amplio, Mutatio, Bestia, Terra
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Some examples of spells (varying power-level) may be found in <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/langband/langband/variants/contraband/config/spells.lisp?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">cvs</a>.
 Some examples of spell-effects and their domain is <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/langband/langband/variants/contraband/config/domain-effects.lisp?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">here</a>.</p>

<table border=1>
  <tr> <td valign=top>
    <p>Pugicio wants to cast "Dissolve Wall" which has difficulty 10, and
    his power level for (mutatio terra) is:</p>
<pre>
technique + domain + charlvl/5

   5      +   5    +   2         =   12
</pre>

    <p>This is a prepared spell with learned spell-effects, ie Pugicio
    already knows this spell.  He must use two wooden runes, and has no
    additional sources of magic he wishes to use. To cast a spell he must
    carry the necessary runes.  His casting-level is:</p>

<pre>
technique + domain + charlvl/5 + preparation + rune power + foci

   5      +   5    +    2      +    0        +     0      +  0    =  12
</pre>

    <p> This means he has an effective skill of 12 to cast a lvl 10
    spell.  His chance of casting it (given that he has enough mana):</p>
    
<pre>
50%      +    5% * (casting-level - spell-level)   =  60%
</pre>
  </td></tr>
</table>

<p>A player cannot cast spells that are more than five levels higher
than their magic power-level (for Pugicio this is 12), that means Pugicio
cannot cast (mutatio terra) spells with higher difficulty than 17.</p>

<table border=1>
  <tr> <td valign=top>
    
    <p>Pugicio wants to cast "Heroes Feast" for him and his friends, this
    spell has difficulty 8, and Pugicion knows that he is good at
    (creo arbor) with a magic power-level of 13.  He also has a silver rune (+3)
    and a stone rune (+1):</p>
    <pre>
technique + domain + charlvl/5 + preparation + rune power + foci
   5      +   6    +    2      +     0       +    3+1     +  0   = 17

50%  + 5% * (17 - 8)  = 95%
    </pre>    

    <p>Pugicio can be fairly sure he can do that spell.</p>
    
  </td></tr>
</table>

<table border=1>
  <tr> <td valign=top>

    <p>Pugicio is in a bad situation, as he is ambushed by a bandit
    wielding a large menacing wooden club.  Pugicio knows that with
    his Arbor and Mutatio skills he can control the bandit's club to hit the
    bandit, but he has not prepared this spell.  He will try
    ad-lib'ing it.  The effect he wants has difficulty 13.</p>
    <pre>
technique + domain + charlvl/5 + preparation + rune power + foci
   5      +   6    +    2      +     -5      +    3+1     +  0   = 12

50% + 5 % * (12-13) = 45%
   </pre>

    <p>Pugicio just might try that as he hopes it will scare the
    bandit.  [Eugene: modificiations may change, and player might be able to
    tweak area of effect on the fly as if creating a spell]</p>
    
  </td></tr>
</table>

<p>The preparations available are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> ad-lib'ing effect: casting time * 1.5, -5 to casting-level
  <li> prepared spell: normal casting time
  <li> ritual: casting-time * 5, +5 to casting-level
</ul>
<p>Some spells can only be cast as rituals due to their power.
Casting-time depends on spell-effect. </p>  



<h3>Creating a spell</h3>

<p> A player may keep spell recipes in books, but he can only have <u>ten</u>
spells readied at a given time.  Creating appropriate spells is a
large part of the system.  Each spell consists of one or more
spell-effects combined with an area of effect and a magic
power-level.  To create a spell a player must know of the
spell-effects needed, possess the runes, possess the runes for the
area of effect and have the necessary magic power-level.  An example
of Pugicio creating a spell for the <tt>rock-to-sand</tt> effect
(basic difficulty 10, default area: touch):</p>

<table border=1>
  <tr> <td valign=top>

    Pugicio wants to create a rock-to-sand spell that allows him to
    destroy a rock wall from a distance instead of touch, this in case
    monsters crawl out from behind the wall.
    <pre>
          basic difficulty  + effect-area + duration-power 
original        10                 0           permanent     = 10
new             10          +      5      +    permanent     = 15
</pre>
  </td></tr>
</table>


(this needs tweaking.. Eugene?  Also need to see what happends if you
combine more elements and possibly even techniques)

<h3>Corruption</h3>

<p>Every time you use a spell in a certain tech+dom combination you
will be corrupted in some ways. Typically each tecnhique and domain
has their own corruption-scale and at certain points you get a visible
corruption or corrupted ability.  These corruptions cannot be
reversed.  Visible corruptions will mark the player as a magician and
will affect reactions from people.  Some other hidden corruptions may
also be found, e.g too much use of creo ignis may make all plants and
trees hostile. ...</p>

<ul>
  <li> Examples of Luna corruptions include madness,
  reflection, lycantrophy.
  <li> Examples Sol corruptions include light auras, burning
  heat, people avoid closeness.
  <li> Bestia corruptions should be obvious :-)
  <li> ...
</ul>

<h3>Magical foci</h3>

<p>All ordinary and magical objects contain some magical properties
that a spell-caster can exploit, e.g a shovel contains some (mutatio
terra) force and a falcon contains some (amplio aeris) force.  This
can also be exploited when making magical items, and objects with high
force in a certain area can also accept larger enchantments of that
kind, e.g a silver shield is excellent for (tutis luna)
enchantements.  When used in spellcasting or rituals the object will
be destroyed, even if the spell didn't succeed.  For spellcasting
maximum 3 foci may be used, for enchanting maximum 5 foci may be used
(in addition to the object being enchanted).</p>
