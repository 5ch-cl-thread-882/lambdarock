<h1>Mythology</h1>

<p>People in both the Empire of Copia and the Kingdom of Atrocitas
worship more than one god.  There doesn't seem to be a supreme
monotheistic god in the universe, and the gods' powers seem to be related to the number
and power of the worshippers.  The Copians usually put an Edex in
front of the names of their gods as titles, and the Atrocitans use
Deus as title for their gods.</p>

<p>The gods seldom play an active part in events, except through pious
followers that can pray for magical powers.  Some gods are known to
grant powers to heal the wounded and sick, others are known to provide
their followers with unnatural combat abilities and others are known
for powers to control weather and plants.  The priests' powers are
seldom, if ever, flashy or directly damaging to others.  As such the
gods have limited influence of events that happen, compared to the big
armies of the kingdom and the empire.</p>

<h3>Known gods in the Empire of Copia</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Edex Bellica - the revered god of the mighty Copian armies and
  of the mighty warrior-priests of the Empire.  Edex Bellica is often
  depicted as a young and ambitious captain on the field, a good
  strategist but joins his men in the battle.  The priests see
  conquest as the best way to honour Edex Bellica.</li>

  <li> Eda Mine - the sister of Edex Bellica and the one who makes
  Edex Bellica's armour, weapons, catapults, wagons and all the other
  crafts needed to wage wars and run a powerful empire.  Her priests
  are expert craftsmen known for creating powerful magical
  weapons.</li>

  <li> Edex Florentin - no Copian trader starts the day without
  blessing Edex Florentin, the patron god of all commerce and the one
  who has made the Copian Empire the richest in the known world.  The
  Copian currency is named after Edex Florentin, and all merchant
  contracts are sworn to be just and honest to Edex Florentin.  The
  priests of Edex Florentin are master economists and serve in all
  parts of the guilds and the government.</li>

  <li> Eda Iudico - the sister of Edex Florentin governs the Law of the
  Empire, and the justice system.  All trials, criminal cases and
  civil cases are governed by a priest of Eda Iudico.  Little is known
  about Eda Iudico outside Copia and even within the empire
  rumours are common.  What is known is that the priests invoke Dea
  Iudico in law matters and the verdict is visible to all parties and
  her decisions are upheld by the bureaucracy and the military.  Eda
  Iduico's decisions are generally perceived as just and fair. </li>

</ul>

<h3>Known gods in the Kingdom of Atrocitas</h3>

<p>There are only three gods in the atrocitan belief system, and one
of the three, Deus Labrusca, is a minor god that for foreigners might
seem as an invented escapism from the grim world of feudalism.</p>

<ul>

  <li> Deus Atrox - has been the dominant god in Atrocitas for many
  centuries and the
  kingdom has taken the name from him.  Deus Atrox is seen by
  atrocitans as the brave god of war that once united the kingdom with
  his knights and then protected the borders from the uncivilised
  barbarian hordes, the Dakau Dogmen and the aggressive Empire of Copia.
  Foreigners see Deus Atrox as a cruel warlord bent on destruction of
  everyone else with all means possible.  The powerful knights of the
  Kingdom pledge allegiance to Deus Atrox and lead the armies into
  battle.  But where infantry armies and their generals have been legends in the Empire
  of Copia, it's the riding Knights of Atrox that are legendary in
  Atrocitas, and the fear of all enemies.  Relations between the
  Knights of Atrox and the followers of Deus Salveus are poor.</li>
  
  <li> Deus Salveus - one of the most recent gods of the Kingdom, and
  a god whose wanderings in the kingdom are well-documented.  Deus
  Salveus was an ordinary commoner raised to be a serf like his father
  before him, and father before him.  At the age of 17 he showed
  healing powers when he healed the mortal wounds the local duke had
  gotten in a battle with Dakau Dogmen.  The young Salveus was granted
  freedom and traveled the countryside the next decade helping the ill,
  learning about herbs and mushrooms, and was the person who identified
  how plagues and diseases spread through unclean water, rats and
  unclean clothes.  He and his followers invented
  sanitation systems, regimes for treating the diseased and cheap
  medicines to treat the many plagues.  This did wonders with the
  poor, and helped saved the Kingdom from an invasion by the Empire of
  Copia.  The generals of Copia thought the Kingdom was weakened by
  plague, but found a healthy population fighting back.  A Copian
  assassin murdered Deus Salveus the next year, but his followers
  continued the work and within a year found that they had been
  granted the powers that Deus Salveus had while alive.  His church is
  today the most influential church in
  Atrocitas with the powerful Prince Adaugeo as patron.  With the
  recent death of the king, the church might become dominant.</li>
  
  <li> Deus Labrusca - is the god of wine, happiness and song, and
  is popular with the people, but unpopular with the serious
  churches.  Especially the Deus Salveus priests have been opposed to
  the consumation of alcohol connected to Deus Labrusca and his
  parties.  The Deus Salveus priests believe that alcohol destroys the
  health of people, and that the poor should
  spend the money on important things and not on wine.  The Deus
  Labrusca priests will happily smile and claim that the poor
  (and the rich) need a party at least once a week.</li>
