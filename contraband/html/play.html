<h1>Playing Contraband</h1>

Some info on various parts of the game. 

<h2>Races</h2>

You can play a human, but your human might have different background
and be from different countries or areas.  Other races may be
introduced later. 

<h2>Classes</h2>

None, you choose your skills and that defines you. 

<h2>Stats</h2>

All stats go from 1 to 100, with starting value of 10 in all stats.
The stats that the player can allocate points to are:
<ul>
  <li> Strength - affects carrying capacity, use of heavy weapons and
  ability to do damage with a weapon.
  
  <li> Agility - affects nimbleness of fingers, ability to avoid
  getting hit by weapons and traps, also affects ability to hit with
  weapons
  
  <li> Constitution - affects ordinary resistance, how many hits a
  character can take and how long he can carry heavy gear

  <li> Self Discipline - affects ability to concentrate, to resist
  mental attacks and connect to sources of power (and remain sane).

  <li> Reasoning - affects the ability to do mathematics, to figure
  out mechanical devices and magical devices, and to understand arcane
  spells and writing.

  <li> Presence - affects the reaction of people and monsters, and can
  be a double-edged sword as a high-presence person will impress both
  friends and foes.  Friends and neutrals will become more positive,
  but foes will hate you stronger and target you.
</ul>

<p>The other stats that will affect your game but which cannot be
allocated points for are:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Reputation - how famous or infamous is the character in the
  area.  Your deeds and how others publish info on you will affect
  this score.  Some things will be easier if you're known, but other
  things will be harder.  This will also vary according to situation
  and is a complex thing, e.g if you're a noble from Atrocitan you
  will be known to atrocitans, but copians won't care.  A high
  reputation may backfire if you want no attention.

  <li> Moral - human behaviour vary from the most egoistic to the most
  unselfish.  With a low score in morale you will be rewarded for being selfish
  and egoistic.  If you have a high score you will be rewarded for
  altruistic deeds.  Quest awards will depends on how well it fits
  with your moral.  If you start with a low moral and constantly do
  quests for the poor with little personal reward your moral will go
  up, and vice versa.  You can decide your starting moral.  A score of
  1 means there is only you in your universe and 100 means that you're
  so altruistic that it borders on self-extinction.  A starting score
  between 30 and 70 is recommended.
  
</ul>

<h2>Skills</h2>

Skills have a value from 1 to 100.  To be able to use a skill you need
at least 1 point in the skill. 

<ul>
  <li> Smithing (can you fix your metal weapons or armour, and even
  make your own weapons and armour?)
  <li> Leatherwork (can you fix your leather sack, armour, pouch,
  shoews, etc?)
  <li> Woodcraft (can you carve out the bow, or know the weak spot of
  a wodden door or fix the wagon that broke?)
  <li> Gemcutting (does the player know his gems, gold and silver
  apart and can craft it into jewelry or decorate weapons and armours?)
  <li> Farming (not adventuring intensive but can do a good job as an
  advisor for farming and become popular with the peasants)
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Appraising (can you estimate the value of objects, important
  for traders and adventurers who can't carry much)
  <li> Trade (do you know how to trade, how to get a profit and how to
  do accounting?)
  <li> Conversation (can you sweet-talk, get more info from people and
  get your way with a silver tongue?)
  <li> Monster Lore (know a lot about monsters and foes and be able to
  know in advance of weaknesses and find weak spots)
  <li> Object Lore (information about objects found and not found,
  knowledge of legends)
  <li> History (do you know the history of the land and can connect
  events and what is said with the history?)
  <li> Intuition (get a hint now and then about hidden dangers, lying
  people, and places to go)
  <li> Languages (understand nuances between languages and understand
  ancient languages and foreign languages.  copia and atrocitas have
  the same language)
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Animal Handling (important to calm down animals, control a
  caravan and know the weak spots of animals)
  <li> Riding  (if riding animals are implemented this will be
  important)
  <li> Tracking (for missions where tracks are visible an interesting,
  probably not included in the first game)
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Alchemy (identify herbs, identify effect of herbs, be able to
  make potions and be able to identify potions)
  <li> Magic devices (can the player use the wand, the rod or activate
  the hat of all-seeing?)
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Pick pocket (can the player steal from others and do
  sleight-of-hand tricks?)
  <li> Security devices (locks, traps, etc.. make and unlock/lock, etc)
  <li> Mechanical devices (can the player use mechanical devices or
  even build them, e.g mechanical+woodwork=catapult or even a crossbow)
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Short blades
  <li> Long blades
  <li> Polearms (spears, halberds, big axes, glaives, ..)
  <li> Mace (hammers, maces, short axes, etc)
  <li> Archery (bows, crossbows, thrown weapons, ..)
  <li> Shield (can the player use a shield efficiently?)
  <li> Heavy Armour
  <li> Light Armour
  <li> Evasion (can the player evade hits, important for all, but most
  important for those with little armour)
</ul>

<h2>Magic system</h2>

<p>Eugene came up with a clever plan, and I put it here right away.  I
think Eugene has captured much of the spirit of Contraband by
suggesting a magic system that "makes sense".  The background and the
world described is relatively like our own, but with a few frightening
roman and medieval fantasies come true.  The world described is in the
early stages of a rennaissance, and then a magic system based on
mathematical and physical laws could easily come from intelligent and
educated magicians. </p>

<pre>
               A Proposal For Controllable Magic System                         
                                                                                
                               Preamble                                         
                                                                                
  Among the most neat features nearly all fantasy computer games are            
lacking is user-customisable magic system. Present-day magic systems            
are rigid, based on a limited subset of D&D spells and largely miss             
the spirit of Art, constraining players to the role of technicians              
using prescribed recipes. This proposal describes one of the possible           
player-controlled magic system (or rather, its combat-related part).            
                                                                                
                                Amble                                           
                                                                                
  To make magic system customisable by average player we want its               
entities to be simple, while permitting enough combinations for it to           
be interesting.

  The incantations in the proposed magic system can be described by             
quintet I = {G, ME, E, V, T}, where G is spell geometry, ME is                  
mass-energy, E is element used, V is spell velocity, and T is spell             
duration.                                                                       
                                                                                
Spell Geometry                                                                  
                                                                                
  Defines the ways the spell will propagate. Can be one of the several          
types:                                                                          
                                                                                
-- Linear (e.g. Magic Missile)                                                  
-- Linear-continuous (e.g. Trail of Light)                                      
-- Radial                                                                       
-- Radial-continuous (Stinking Cloud)                                           
-- Dot (useful for defensive)

Elements                                                                        
                                                                                
  Element is a substance the incantation operates with. The effect of           
spell cast is largely determined by element used. Below is an approximate       
list of possible elements:                                                      
                                                                                
-- Light                                                                        
-- Acid                                                                         
-- Gas                                                                          
-- Frost                                                                        
-- Fire                                                                         
-- Sound                                                                        
-- Ether                                                                        
-- Chaos                                                                        
...                                                                             

Mass-Energy                                                                     
                                                                                
  Mass-energy determines two factors: the purpose of the spell, and             
how strong the effect (specified by certain Element) will be. Negative          
mass-energy specifies that the spell is defensive (say, negative ME of          
element Acid creates protection from acid), positive ME is applied on           
foes. The numerical value shows the quantity of element being applied.          
                                                                                
                                                                                
Velocity                                                                        
                                                                                
  A numeric value specifying how fast the spell effect                          
propagates. Irrelevant for defensive spells.                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
Duration                                                                        
                                                                                
  A numeric value specifying how many turns the spell will be                   
active. Irrelevant for missile spells.                                          

                             Inscriptions                                       
                                                                                
  The incantations are subject to sequencing/composition, so that               
complex and special-purpose spells can be produced. Say, combining              
Radial-continuous Fire spell with Dot Fire resistance spell can make            
sense. A hunt for specific monster surrounded with numerous companions          
may take advantage of specific spells too.                                      
                                                                                
  The inscriptions should be made on some media (book, scroll), and             
later can be memorised or cast by player. The language can be based on          
latin-like vocabulary, or Tengwar, on Old English, Old Norse, sexprs,           
whatever.                                                                       
                                                                                
  It should be still possible to encode many of AD&D spells within              
proposed magic system.                                                          

                                Costs                                           
                                                                                
  Each component of the quintet costs mana points to magic user. The            
more complex geometry patterns are used, the more deadly elements               
summoned, the more mass-energy is involved, the faster and longer               
spell acts - the more it costs.
