<h3>Kingdom of Atrocitas</h3>


<p>The Kingdom has a prestigious Acdemy in Atrobürg that has been 
<p>Something changed though... A century ago, Professor Tipler, who
taught classes on natural and mechanical processes at the Royal Academy in
Atrobürg publicly claimed that there had never been magical beasts and that the
gods were long time dead.  He called upon people to study and do
research on nature and the processes of nature, and then document this
research in one place.  The plan was to create a library for all of Atrocitas where
everyone could learn how to use the nature in order to survive in a
godless and magicless world.  Descriptions in the library of mineral
attractions, herbal medicine, et.al had to be free of explanations
relying on "religious" and "magical" "leaps of faith".  If it was
magic, it should be demonstratable to be magic. Tipler and his
students set forth disciplined ways to analyse the knowledge proofs
with demands for demonstrations and reproducability.</p>

<p>The Church of Deus Salveus weren't pleased with claims of their god
being dead, but being devoted to medicine and similar research of nature,
they joined the project and provided much of their herb and disease
lore.  Much to the surprise of the Tiplerians (as they were called)
was that the knowledge of the doctors and priests of Deus Salveus was
mostly mundane and required few divine miracles.</p>

<p>The dominant Church of Deus Atrox weren't so pleased, in fact they
were outraged by the claims and the project.  They claimed the Academy
and Tipler were legitimating blasphemy and obvious lies, which was
contrary to all good scientific principles.  They wanted the whole
project stopped and the professor fired from the university.</p>

<p>Two months after losing his job, the professor was killed by a
drunk knight in a seedy bar, over an argument of whether blessed beer was
better than normal beer.   His project, Recordatio
Natura, carried on slowly for decades by some professors and some of
their students, but with little support from officials or outsiders.
The last two decades the project has gotten financial support by Prince
Callidus, himself a former student at the Academy.  After Prince
Callidus gave official support, a few merchant houses and guilds have
dared to sponsor research for new and cheaper products. A few early
successes have helped the recent success:</p>

<blockquote>
At the autumn festival of Deus Atrox, the atrocitans eat lambs to
celebrate military successes, and for it to be a proper celebration
meal the citizens have had to buy expensive "magical" spices from the
church for the cooking.  The magic in the spices ensures that everyone
is happy after eating the lamb and it's a day used to forgive even
your most hated enemy.  Tiplerians however found out that a spodumene
ore (containing the metal lithium) that went through some alchemical
treatment provided the same benefit, and even without the headaches
the "magical" spices caused the next day.  In only a decade the
expensive "magic" of the church was replaced by the "Autumn Drink"
sold by one of the merchants that had sponsored the research in
spodumene.  Needless to say, the Church of Deus Atrox is furious. 
</blockquote>

<p>Although the collection of information is not enormous, the major
importance of the project was a signal to other researchers that
nature and phenomenons can be studied as separate from the gods and magic.  Before
this it was common for professors to use "Proof by magic", ie refer to
ad hoc magical or divine forces, to explain a phenomenon.  Researchers
in Atrocitas now demand better explanations, and if it's a claim of
magic or divine influence they
want to see it demonstrated.  Ironically the researchers haven't stopped
believing in gods or in magic, they just want their effects to be
documented, and put into a system. </p>

<p>While parts of the Academy have picked up an anti-magic stance,
some researchers, mainly the alchemists, have gradually moved their
work to more rural and even isolated
settings to study nature as a source of magical potential.  These
researchers are genuinely interested in the magic, and study texts and
items of
the old days, themagical properties of herbs and animals, and are trying
to recreate the magic of old.  The difference between this new
generation of students of magic and the earlier ones is the
approach. The new generation uses a disciplined approach not unlike that of the men of the academy.  The
church view these researchers with scepticism and commoners need
little nudging to burn them. The students of magic have not come very
far yet, as they are not many and they study very different parts
where magical behaviour is observed; runestones created by magicians,
spell-rituals, magical beasts, lycantrophy, powers of magical plants
and parts of animals, ... This varied group are often referred to as
the Ordinatio Magi, even though it's hardly a formal order.</p>

<p>For commoners this scientific schism is mostly unknown and does not
affect their life much.  For most nobles it doesn't matter much either,
as their primary source of power is armoured knights and neither
the magic-researchers nor the mundane-researchers have yet to come up
with anything of significant military value.  The church worries because young
nobles are taught these anti-gods theories in the Academy, but they're
unsure what they will do next.</p>




<h3>The Empire of Copia</h3>

<p>The Atrocitans might worry about the gradual disappaerance of their
gods and the magic that was so common to their forests, but the
copians don't share that fear.
