<h1>Factions active</h1>

<h3>Atrocitan Army</h3>

<p>Only has an active role in the last stages of the conflict.  At the
start of the game they're gathering for an exercise in north
Atrocitas.  Some border forts, but nothing of importance. </p>

<h3>Atrocitan Government/Foreign Service</h3>

<p>Actively working on and driving the plot.  Led by Prince Callidus
at the moment.  Atrocitan player starts here.  Can in special
circumstances be joinable by copian player.</p>

Members: Consul Tepesco in Bartertown, Duke Larethian in Atrobürg

<h3>Atrocitan Trading Guild</h3>

<p>Will do their best to strengthen and continue trade, almost at any
cost.  They have gotten hint of the govt needing ore, armours and
weapons and will try to get hold of that.  They're in general not
informed of what is going on and will mostly worry about maximising
profit whatever it takes.  Exploitable by both sides.  Not joinable.</p>

<h3>Church of Deus Atrox</h3>

<p>Will not be active at the beginning, but will start crossing the
border to investigate ruins and to spy on the imperial troops.
They'll also be happy to give out assignments to destroy Edex Bellica
priests and shrines.  Will also try to capture imperial caravans with
weapons and armour.  Acting fairly independent of the atrocitan
government, but they suspect the copian are up to something and are
only happy to screw up things for the copians. Joinable. </p>

<h3>Church of Deus Salveus</h3>

<p>Will mostly be preaching, doing social work, establishing relations
with elves, copian traders and try to stop smuggling of degrading
contraband like liquor, drugs and weapons.  Can be used as informants
for a clever atrocitan spy.  Joinable. </p>

<h3>Church of Edex Bellica</h3>

<p>Will be active trying to stop the hated Deus Salveus priests, using
bribes, harassment, blackmail and outright attacks.  Will do their
outmost to trick other factions into destroying the Deus Salveus
operations.  When the Deus Atrox priests start getting active the Edex
Bellica priests will be concerned, but they're a bit set in their ways
and will still feel that the healers from Deus Salveus are their
enemies.  Joinable.</p>

<h3>Copian Merhcant Guild</h3>

<p>Will describe themselves as a gang of idealists working to provide
the people of Copia with cheap wares, and for fun the first mission
from them will be to deliver food to a starving family (and fix their
wolf problem).  They're basically an only-for-profit organisation, but
love to hook newcomers with such missions to pass off as credible.
These guys will do anything for money, and should be exploitable for
both sides, but most of all for the atrocitan player.  Only in the end
game will there be directives to the low-level traders to stop trading
with atrocitas and to help the legions.  Joinable for copian player
that needs a cover story.</p>

<h3>Dakau Dogmen</h3>

<p>The dogmen will be described as ruthless barbarians by everyone,
but in their mountain castles they live a good life.  They are mixes
of a dog and a man, like a minotaur is a mix of man and bull.  The dog
they resemble varies greatly but also affect their roles in society
and their behaviour.. cf Planet of the Apes for a parallell.  They
will do occasional raids and attacks, but will mostly be targets for
both nationalities.  Prince Vehem is captured by them and kept in a
bad prison cell.  They don't really know who they have captured, so
they're unprepared for a big rescue operation.  Not joinable.</p>

<h3>Duke Giuseppi's business</h3>

<p>One of the active traders in the area is the atrocitan Duke
Giuseppi, and he is aiding the Deus Salveus priests.  He also works
with smugglers and might be put up as a minor villain or someone
corruptible by the copians.. he'll look after his interests, but he's
eventually loyal to Prince Callidus and Prince Adaugeo.  Joinable by
copian player. </p> 


<h3>Grey Cloaks</h3>

<p>A secret order of atrocitan magicians that operate in the border
areas.  They are a source of magic knowledge and missions, but the
members range from cruel to gentle.  One of them does experiments on
copian citizens while another one is protecting scared villagers from
wolves.  Should be played as villains and mystery mages, but they are
just a rag-tag bunch of dedicated magicians that have been exiled by
Atrocitas (but mostly love their country and some would do a lot to
come home).  Joinable. </p>

<h3>Imperial Agency</h3>

<p> Feared by copians and atrocitans.  They will do lots of operations,
but not always for the greater good of Copia.  Assassination, spying,
torture, etc are their business.  Think Gestapo.  Copian player starts
as a member. </p>

<h3>Imperial Justice</h3>

<p> Guards, judges and everyone dealing with civilian law and order
are parts of the Imperial Justice.  These guys typically are lenient
with copian crimes against atrocitans, and they fear imperial agents.
They will however at times be overly brave and assert their power.  In
case of a war the Imperial Legion will declare martial law and do
policing. Joinable for a copian.  Good cover story, but will happily
give jobs to independent bounty hunters. </p>

<h3>Imperial Legion</h3>

<p>The proud legions of the Copians are respected by the people and
the soldiers are only happy to exploit this respect.  Discipline is
poor at the start of the game and both players might easily find
informants who would do much for gold.  Gradually there will be more
soldiers, more officers and better security.  Their main tasks will be
to fix logistics and move the armies to the area as silently as
possible. Joinable by copian player.</p>

<h3>Knights of the Lambda Calculus</h3>

<p>These knights of old times will not be part of the early game, but
rumours of them abound.  They live in the castle at the top of Lambda
Rock and the dungeons below.  They were once powerful knights of the
area but when the Empire came they gradually retreated to the castle
where they kept to themselves for centuries.  Some are undead and some
are living off longevity potions.  They developed a magical system in
the old days called Lambda Calculus which worked by setting together
runes crafted from ancient magic materials.  They will probably remain
hidden unless convinced to join a side in the upcoming war.  They can
also be a source of magic knowledge.  Not joinable. </p>

<h3>Lambda Thief Guild</h3>

<p> The thief guild of Lambda Rock has always been a strong presence
and has always had ripe pickings from the trade and the military
presence.  They also do business in Bartertown but they prefer Lambda
Rock where they have a large underground complex.  They plan to be on
the winning side in an upcoming war but will be happy to profit on
everything that is happening.  Disliked by most other factions.
Joinable.</p> 

<h3>Mereo Ulydes' business</h3>

<p>The good Mereo has plenty of business interest and he is not
informed of the schemes going on. He is an ardent defender of the
merchant guild, but will happily let his own business get any
advantage it can.  Bribable and will do most things for money.  Will
also apply for asylum in Atrocitas if things get too hot.  Can also be
exploited by copians for their interest.  Can join him as handyman.</p> 

<h3>Ovidians</h3>

<p>The secret poet society of the border towns.  Both copians and
atrocitans are members and meet in a cave, where they recite their own
poetry and that of old masters.  They will also sponsor art projects,
theatre troupes and will put up posters in the middle of the night
with poetry.  Their role in the game is to provide some relief and to do odd
events.  Joinable by literate players. </p>

Members: Consul Tepesco, two gery cloaks, ...

<h3>Prince Adaugeo's knights</h3>

<p>Knights who've dedicated themselves to the Prince and to Deus
Salveus and will fight to death for their beliefs.  They will play a
small part later in the game.  Joinable.</p>

<h3>Prince Callidus' business empire</h3>

<p>Prince Callidus has a business going that is also in operation led
by Lord Antonius.  They will actively trade with Bartertown and among
other things also buy suspicious and illegal goods.  They might
conflict with many others, and will be easy to see as villains.  Not
really joinable, but might provide missions and foes. 

<h3>Prince Vehemen's knights</h3>

<p>A gang of noble knights that live up to medieval myths about
gallant knights at home and ruthless warriors on the battlefield.
Fighting these men will not be fun.  Some are captured with their
prince and some are assisiting scouts and some are at one of their
northern castles, waiting for news.  They will be useful if Prince
Vehemen is freed.  They have magic weapons and knowledge of magical
arts, but will not reveal that to the players.  Joinable for the
atrocitan who is an atrocitan noble. </p>

<h3>The Elves</h3>

<p>A mysterious people who live peacefully in the forest, minding
their own business.  They try to stay away from copians and any
villagers.  Not very good fighters and mostly afraid of the imperial
legions.  Are also afraid of the mounted atrocitans but tend to get
along well with atrocitan civilians.  Treated right they will help
atrocitans with information gathering, and if push comes to shove they
will assist with a regiment of archers in a war aginst the hated
copians.  Their skill with medicine is also a source for knowledge for
a player.  Not joinable.</p>

<h3>The Emperor</h3>

<p>The emperor will in the first parts of the game be invisible but he
will send special agents later in the game and appear when there's a
war.  His men and guards are heavily armed.  An assault on him is
unlikely.  He does not trust the agency fully nor his
generals. Already joined by copian player via agency.  Not joinable
for atrocitan player.</p>

<h3>West River Smugglers</h3>

<p>The West River Smugglers are possibly the most efficient smugglers
in the area and will take on work from anyone, for a pay of 25% of the
contraband.  They'll take work from both sides but will sometimes tax
atrocitans more.  The Imperial Legion wants to put these guys six feet
under and the legion will support missions against them.  The Imperial
Justice is a bit more lenient but will try to stop blatant smuggling.
Important in the first part of the game as foes and service
contributors.  Not really joinable.</p>
